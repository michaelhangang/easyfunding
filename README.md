3. Technique Details
Spring Boot is used to build microservices including common api module, service-base api, core service, short message service and file storage service. Spring Cloud connects these microservices through Nacos, OpenFeign, Sentinel and Gateway. Nacos serves as services registry center to help discover, configure, and manage the microservices. OpenFeign is used by a service to remotely call another microservice by simple declarative annotations. 

When one service synchronously calls another, there's a possibility that another service can be down for some reason. In such a case, threads are blocked as they keep on waiting for the other service to respond. To prevent such scenarios, Sentinel blocks all subsequent calls immediately and use a fallback method to respond.
